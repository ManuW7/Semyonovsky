          The Cultural Quarter of Semyonovsky has deep historical ties to the
          Brusnitsyn family. This family is recognized for founding the Tannery
          located on the Tannery Line of Vasilievsky Island. <br />
          <br /> Nikolai Mokeevich, who arrived in St. Petersburg from the Tver
          Province, established a modest tanning workshop in 1847, employing
          just 10 people at the time.
